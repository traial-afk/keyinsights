## Why Traditional Research Falls Short

Let’s be honest—old ways of researching companies and markets just can’t keep up anymore. Imagine grinding through databases, piecing together financials, and manually updating spreadsheets for hours. It’s:

- **Tedious:** Analysts spend days (not hours) on repetitive, time-consuming tasks.
- **Disjointed:** Information comes from different places, and it doesn’t always line up, which means missed chances or duplicated work.
- **Narrow in Focus:** Smaller and midsize private companies often get skipped over. That means hidden gems stay hidden.

In today’s high-stakes, fast-paced M&A scene, relying on these outdated methods can slow you down—or worse, send a great opportunity right into your competitor’s hands.

## Strategic Expert Advice for AI Adoption

AI is powerful, but it’s not a miracle cure. Real results come from using AI thoughtfully and strategically. At the MIT Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition Summit, top leaders shared firsthand advice to make AI adoption work in the real world—not just in theory.

### Practical Guidance From the MIT Summit

**1. Kick the Tires Like a Hedge Fund (Mark Valdez, Eads Bridge Holdings):**  
- Run careful due diligence on potential AI partners (don’t just buy the sales pitch).
- Start with small pilot projects and watch how they perform before you scale up.

**2. Go Small, Go Smart (Linda Drabik, Marencik Solutions):**  
- Focus on a few high-impact ways AI could help—forget the idea that “everything must be AI.”
- Double-check your data quality; messy data causes bad outcomes.
- Be open with your team: AI is here to support, not replace people. Investing in training keeps spirits high and results strong.

**3. Celebrate Small Wins (Scott Barstow, Pacific Lake Partners):**  
- Find quick wins—like automating simple workflows or pulling reports faster.
- Don’t bite off too much at once. Build trust by proving value bit by bit.
