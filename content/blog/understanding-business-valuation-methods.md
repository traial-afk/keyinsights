Valuation is both an art and a science. While financial models provide a quantitative foundation, understanding the qualitative aspects of a business is equally crucial.

### 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

The DCF method estimates the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. It's widely used for established businesses with predictable income.

### 2. Market Multiples

This approach compares your business to similar companies that have recently been sold. Common metrics include Price-to-Earnings (P/E) and EV/EBITDA ratios.

### 3. Asset-Based Valuation

Focused on the net asset value of the company, this method is often used for liquidation scenarios or asset-heavy industries.
